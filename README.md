# Flexible Batches for OpenAI

This is a united TypeScript API for OpenAI batch and non-batch mode. It also supports bigger logical batches than allowed by OpenAI.

**This software wasn't tested.**

I developed this software for faster debugging cycle of OpenAI batch processing, because normally batches take up to 24h.

To add to your project, use
```
npm i flexible-batches
```
or
```
yarn add flexible-batches
```
